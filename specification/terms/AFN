    Ancestral File is a computerized collection of genealogies that links 
    families into pedigrees, showing ancestors and descendants. Ancestral 
    File was created from thousands of user submitted pedigree charts, family 
    group sheets, and GEDCOM files. An Ancestral File Number was assigned to
    every record that was published in Ancestral File.
