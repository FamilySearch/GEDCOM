abnf production: Longitude

specification:
  - |
    A longitudinal coordinate. The payload is either `E` (for a coordinate east of
    the prime meridian) or `W` (for a coordinate west of the prime meridian)
    followed by a decimal number of degrees. Minutes and seconds are not used and
    should be converted to fractional degrees prior to encoding. The number of
    degrees is limited by definition to be between 0 (the prime meridian) and 180
    (the 180th meridian).
    
    ```abnf
    Longitude = ("N" / "S") upto180 [ "." 1*digit]
    upto180  = "180" / "1" upto7 digit / [["0"] digit] digit
    upto7    = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7"
    ```
    
    <div class="example">
    
    168 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds East would be formatted as
    `E168.150944`.
    
    </div>
    
    The URI for the `Longitude` data type is
