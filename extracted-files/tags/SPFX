    <div class="example">
    
    "Lt. Cmndr. Joseph Allen jr.” might be presented as
    
    ```gedcom
    1 NAME Lt. Cmndr. Joseph /Allen/ jr.
    2 NPFX Lt. Cmndr.
    2 GIVN Joseph
    2 SURN Allen
    2 NSFX jr.
    ```
    
    </div>
    
    This specification does not define how the meaning of multiple parts with the
    same tag differs from the meaning of a single part with a concatenated larger
    payload. However, some applications allow the user to chose whether to combine
    or split name parts, meaning the tag quantity should be treated as expressing
    at least a user preference. Even when multiple `SURN` tags are used, the
    `PersonalName` data type identifies a single surname substring between its
    slashes.
