uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/LANG

standard tag: LANG

specification:
  - Language
  - |
    The primary human language of the superstructure. The primary language in
    which the Text-typed payloads of the superstructure and its substructures
    appear.
    
    The payload of the LANG structure is a language tag, as defined by BCP 47.
    A registry of component subtags is maintained publicly by the IANA.
    
    In the absence of a LANG structure, the language is assumed to be
    unspecified; that may also be recorded explicitly with language tag und
    (meaning “undetermined”). See https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/HEAD-LANG for
    information about applying language-specific algorithms to text in an
    unspecified language.
    
    If the text is primarily in one language with a few parts in a different
    language, it is recommended that a language tag identifying the primary
    language be used. If no one language is primary, the language tag mul
    (meaning “multiple”) may be used, but most language-specific algorithms
    will treat mul the same way they do und.
    
    Conversations are ongoing about adding part-of-payload language tagging in
    a future version of the specification to provide more fidelity for
    multilingual text.
    
    If the text is not in any human language and should not be treated as
    lingual content, the language tag zxx (meaning “no linguistic content” or
    “not applicable”) may be used. An example of zxx text might be a diagram
    approximated using characters for their shape, not their meaning.
    
    This specification does not permit LANG in every place where human language
    text might appear. Conversations are ongoing about adding it in more places
    in a future version of the specification. Using the current specification,
    additional language tagging can be accomplished using a documented
    extension tag by including the following in the header:
    
        1 SCHEMA
        2 TAG _LANG https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/LANG
    
    and using the extension tag like so:
    
        2 DATE 31 AUG 2018
        3 PHRASE 2018年8月31日
        4 _LANG cmn
