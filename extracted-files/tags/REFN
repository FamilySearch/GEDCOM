standard tag: 'REFN'

specification:
  - Reference
  - |
    A user-defined number or text that the submitter uses to identify the
    superstructure. For instance, it may be a record number within the submitter's
    automated or manual system, or it may be a page and position number on a
    pedigree chart.
    
    This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
    Multiple structures describing different aspects of the same subject must not
    have the same `REFN` value.
  - |
    <div class="deprecation">
    
    Having an `EXID` without an `EXID`.`TYPE` substructure is deprecated. The
    meaning of an `EXID` depends on its `EXID`.`TYPE`. The cardinality of
    `EXID`.`TYPE` will be changed to `{1:1}` in version 8.0.
    
    </div>
    
    Each of these provides an identifier for a structure or its subject, and each
    is different in purpose:
    
    - `REFN` is a user-generated identifier for a structure.
    
    - `UID` is a globally-unique identifier for a structure.
    
    - `EXID` is an identifier maintained by an external authority that applies to
      the subject of the structure.
