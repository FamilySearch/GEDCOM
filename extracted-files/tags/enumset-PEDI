    <div class="note">
    
    It is known that some users have interpreted `BIRTH` to mean "genetic parent"
    and others to mean "social parent at time of birth". Definitions differ in many
    circumstances (infidelity, surrogacy, sperm donation, and so on). Hence,
    applications should refrain from asserting it has either meaning in imported
    data.

    The structures for foster children in particular, and family relationships in
    general, are known to have undesirable limitations and are likely to change in
    a future version of this specification.

    <div class="note">
    
    `SEALING` implies that a `SLGC` event was performed, and it is recommended that
    this enumeration value only be used when the `SLGC` event is present in the
    GEDCOM file. `ADOPTED`, on the other hand, only implies a social relationship
    which may or may not have any associated `ADOP` event.
