standard tag: TEXT

specification:
  - Text from Source
  - A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This
    indicates notes or text that are actually contained in the source document,
    not the submitter’s opinion about the source. This should be, from the
    evidence point of view, “what the original record keeper said” as opposed
    to the researcher’s interpretation.
