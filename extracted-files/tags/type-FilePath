specification:
  - |
    The file path data type describes where an digital file is located in a
    machine-readable way. Syntactically, the payload is a URI reference as defined
    by [RFC 3986], or a valid URL string as defined by the [WHATWG URL
    specification]. That is, it can be an absolute or relative URL, optionally
    with a fragment string.
    
    Version 7.0 only supports the following URLs:
    
    - A URL with scheme `ftp`, `http`, or `https` refers to a **web-accessible
      file**.
    
    - A URL with scheme `file` refers to either a **local file** or a **non-local
      file**, as defined by [RFC 8089]. Local file URLs must not be used in
      [FamilySearch GEDZIP] nor when sharing datasets on the web or with unknown
      parties, but may be used for close collaboration between parties with known
      similar file structures.
    
    - A URI reference with all of the following:
    
      - no scheme
      - not beginning with `/` (U+002F)
      - not containing any path segments equal to `..` (U+002E U+002E)
      - not containing a reverse solidus character (U+005C `\`) or `banned`
        character, either directly or in escaped form
      - no query or fragment
    
      refers to a **local file**. If the dataset is part of a [GEDZIP file], the
      URL of the local file is a zip archive filename; otherwise, the URL of a
      local file is resolved with *base* equal to the directory containing the
      dataset.
    
      It is recommended that local files use the directory prefix `media/`, but
      doing so is not required.
    
      For compatibility with [GEDZIP] and related formats, it is recommended that
      the following file paths not be used:
    
      - `gedcom.ged`
      - `MANIFEST.MF`
      - any URL beginning `META-INF/`
    
    Additional URLs may be supported in future versions of this specification.
    
    The URI for the `FilePath` data type is
    `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/type-FilePath`.
