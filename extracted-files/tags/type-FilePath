specification:
  - |
    The file path data type describes where an digital file is located in a
    machine-readable way. Syntactically, the payload is a URI reference as defined
    by [RFC 3986], or a valid URL string as defined by the [WHATWG URL
    specification]. That is, it can be an absolute or relative URL, optionally
    with a fragment string.
    
    Version 7.0 only supports the following URLs:
    
    - A URL with scheme `ftp`, `http`, or `https` refers to a **web-accessible
      file**.
    
    - A URL with scheme `file` refers to either a **local file** or a **non-local
      file**, as defined by [RFC 8089]. Local file URLs must not be used in
      [FamilySearch GEDZIP] and should be avoided in datasets that are expected
      to be shared on the web or with unknown parties, but may be appropriate for
      close collaboration between parties with known similar file structures.
    
    - A URI reference with all of the following:
    
      - no scheme
      - not beginning with `/` (U+002F)
      - not containing any path segments equal to `..` (U+002E U+002E)
      - not containing a reverse solidus character (U+005C `\`) or `banned`
        character, either directly or in escaped form
      - no query or fragment
    
      refers to a **local file**. If the dataset is part of a [GEDZIP file], the
      URL of the local file is a zip archive filename; otherwise, the URL of a
      local file is resolved with *base* equal to the directory containing the
      dataset.
    
      It is recommended that local files use the directory prefix `media/`, but
      doing so is not required.
    
      For compatibility with [GEDZIP] and related formats, it is recommended that
      the following file paths not be used:
    
      - `gedcom.ged`
      - `MANIFEST.MF`
      - any URL beginning `META-INF/`
    
    Additional URLs may be supported in future versions of this specification.
    
    The URI for the `FilePath` data type is
    `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/type-FilePath`.
