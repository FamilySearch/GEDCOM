abnf production: Latitude

specification:
  - |
    A latitudinal coordinate. The payload is either `N` (for a coordinate north of
    the equator) or `S` (for a coordinate south of the equator) followed by a
    decimal number of degrees. Minutes and seconds are not used and should be
    converted to fractional degrees prior to encoding. The number of degrees is
    limited by definition to be between 0 (the equator) and 90 (the north or south
    pole).
    
    ```abnf
    Latitude = ("N" / "S") upto90 [ "." 1*digit]
    upto90   = "90" / [upto8] digit
    upto8    = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8"
    ```
    
    <div class="example">
    
    18 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds North would be formatted as
    `N18.150944`.
    
    </div>
    
    The URI for the `Latitude` data type is
