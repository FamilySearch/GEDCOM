standard tag: SNOTE

specification:
  - Shared note
  - A note that is shared by multiple structures. See SHARED_NOTE_RECORD for
    more.
  - |
    A catch-all location for information that does not fully fit within other
    structures. It may include research notes, additional context, alternative
    interpretations, reasoning, and so forth.
    
    A shared note record may be pointed to by multiple other structures. Shared
    notes should only be used if editing the note in one place should edit it
    in all other places or if the note itself requires an IDENTIFIER_STRUCTURE.
    If each instance of the note may be edited separately and no identifier is
    needed, a NOTE should be used instead.
    
    Each SNOTE.TRAN must have either a MIME or LANG substructure or both.
    
    The origin of a name might be a reasonable shared note, while the reason a
    particular person was given that name may make more sense as a non-shared
    note.
    
        0 @GORDON@ SNOTE "Gordon" is a traditional Scottish surname.
        1 CONT It became a given name in honor of Charles George Gordon.
        0 @I1@ INDI
        1 NAME Gordon /Jones/
        2 NOTE Named after the astronaut Gordon Cooper
        2 SNOTE @GORDON@
    
    The ability to have multiple structures share a single note using pointers
    was introduced in version 5.0 in 1991. However, as of 2021 relatively few
    applications have a user interface that presents shared notes as such to
    users. It is recommended that SNOTE be avoided when NOTE will suffice.
    
    A SHARED_NOTE_RECORD may contain a pointer to a SOURCE_RECORD and vice
    versa. Applications must not create datasets where these mutual pointers
    form a cycle. Applications should also ensure they can handle invalid files
    with such cycles in a safe manner.
