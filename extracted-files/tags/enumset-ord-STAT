specification:
  - |
    These values were formerly used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints for coordinating between temples and members. They are no longer used in
    that way, meaning their interpretation is subject to individual user
    interpretation
    
    The definition of some of these values combined with the official policies of
    the church mean that some values only make sense under a subset of [ordinance
    structures]. These contexts are identified in the "applies to" column below,
    and it is recommended that applications follow those guidelines. These
    recommendations were not present when these enumeration values were first
    introduced in version 5.3 so uses that do not conform to the "applies to"
    guidelines may be encountered; if so, they should be treated by applications
    like any other user-specified but semantically-strange data.
    
    The definition of some of these values combined with the official policies of
    the church and the move of the church away from using GEDCOM for handling
    ordinance requests make them redundant and/or no longer relevant. If so, that
    is indicated in the "status" column below. Like the "applies to" column, the
    "status" column is a recommendation, not a requirement, and applications should
    be prepared to encounter non-current values.
