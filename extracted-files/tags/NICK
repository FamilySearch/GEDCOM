    <div class="note">
    
    The label "nickname" and description text of this structure were introduced
    with version 5.5 in 1996, but are understood differently by different users.
    Some use `NICK` only for names that would be inappropriate in formal settings.
    Some use it for pseudonyms regardless of where they are used. Some use it for
    any variant of a name that is not the one used on legal documents. Because all
    of these uses, and likely others as well, are common in existing data, no
    further clarification of the meaning of the `NICK` structure is possible
    without contradicting some existing data.
