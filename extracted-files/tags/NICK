type: structure

uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/NICK

standard tag: 'NICK'

specification:
  - Nickname
  - |
    A descriptive or familiar name that is used instead of, or in addition to,
    one’s official or legal name.
    
    <div class="note">
    
    The label "nickname" and description text of this structure were introduced
    with version 5.5 in 1996, but are understood differently by different users.
    Some use `NICK` only for names that would be inappropriate in formal settings.
    Some use it for pseudonyms regardless of where they are used. Some use it for
    any variant of a name that is not the one used on legal documents. Because all
    of these uses, and likely others as well, are common in existing data, no
    further clarification of the meaning of the `NICK` structure is possible
    without contradicting some existing data.
    
    </div>
  - |
    Optional isolated name parts; see `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE` for more details.
    
    <div class="example">
    
    "Lt. Cmndr. Joseph Allen jr.” might be presented as
    
    ```gedcom
    1 NAME Lt. Cmndr. Joseph /Allen/ jr.
    2 NPFX Lt. Cmndr.
    2 GIVN Joseph
    2 SURN Allen
    2 NSFX jr.
    ```
    
    </div>
    
    This specification does not define how the meaning of multiple parts with the
    same tag differs from the meaning of a single part with a concatenated larger
    payload. However, some applications allow the user to chose whether to combine
    or split name parts, meaning the tag quantity should be treated as expressing
    at least a user preference. Even when multiple `SURN` tags are used, the
    `PersonalName` data type identifies a single surname substring between its
    slashes.
