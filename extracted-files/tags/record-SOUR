specification:
  - Source
  - A description of an entire source. See SOURCE_RECORD for more.
  - |
    A source record describes an entire source. A source may also point to
    REPOs to describe repositories or archives where the source document may be
    found. The part of a source relevant to a specific fact, such as a specific
    page or entry, is indicated in a SOURCE_CITATION that points to the source
    record.
    
    This sourcing model is known to be insufficient for some use cases and may
    be refined in a future version of this specification.
    
    A SOURCE_RECORD may contain a pointer to a SHARED_NOTE_RECORD and vice
    versa. Applications must not create datasets where these mutual pointers
    form a cycle. Applications should also ensure they can handle invalid files
    with such cycles in a safe manner.
