specification:
  - Source
  - A description of an entire source. See `SOURCE_RECORD` for more details.
  - |
    A source record describes an entire source. A source may also point to `REPO`s
    to describe repositories or archives where the source document may be found.
    The part of a source relevant to a specific fact, such as a specific page or
    entry, is indicated in a `SOURCE_CITATION` that points to the source record.
    
    <div class="note">
    
    This sourcing model is known to be insufficient for some use cases and may be
    refined in a future version of this specification.
    
    </div>
    
    A `SOURCE_RECORD` may contain a pointer to a `SHARED_NOTE_RECORD` and vice
    versa. Applications must not create datasets where these mutual pointers form a
    cycle. Applications should also ensure they can handle invalid files with such
    cycles in a safe manner.
