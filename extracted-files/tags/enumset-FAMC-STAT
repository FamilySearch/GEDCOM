specification:
  - |
    When these enumeration values were introduced in version 5.5.1 it was assumed,
    but never specified, that "proven" referred to [the definition provided by the
    Board for Certification of Genealogists]. Because that meaning was not
    specified and other definitions of "proven" exist, existing files might use
    these values in other ways.
    
    <div class="note">
    
    The structures for representing the strength of and confidence in various
    claims are known to be inadequate and are likely to change in a future version
    of this specification.
