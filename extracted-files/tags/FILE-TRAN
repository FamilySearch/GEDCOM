specification:
  - Translation
  - |
    A type of `TRAN` for external media files. Each
    `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/NOTE-TRAN` must have a `FORM` substructure. See
    also `FILE` and the [File Path datatype].
    
    <div class="example">
    
    If an mp3 audio file has been transcoded as an ogg file and a timestamped
    transcript has been extracted as a WebVTT file, the resulting set of files
    might be presented as follows:
    
    ```gedcom
    0 @EX@ OBJE
    1 FILE media/original.mp3
    2 FORM audio/mp3
    2 TRAN media/derived.oga
    3 FORM audio/ogg
    2 TRAN media/transcript.vtt
    3 FORM text/vtt
    ```
    
    </div>
    
    Note that `FILE`.`TRAN` refers to translation to a different digital format,
    not to translation to a different human language. Files that differ in the
    human language of their content should each be given their own `FILE`
    structure.
  - |
    A representation of the superstructure's data in a different format.
    
    In some situations it is desirable to provide the same semantic content in
    multiple formats. Where this is desirable, a `TRAN` substructure is used, where
    the specific format is given in its language tag substructure, media type
    substructure, or both.
    
    Different `TRAN` structures are used in different contexts to fully capture the
    structure of the information being presented in multiple formats. In all cases,
    a `TRAN` structure's payload and substructures should provide only information
    also contained in the `TRAN` structures' superstructure, but provide it in a
    new language, script, or media type.
    
    Each `TRAN` substructure must have either a language tag or a media type or
    both. Each `TRAN` structure must differ from its superstructure and from every
    other `TRAN` substructure of its superstructure in either its language tag or
    its media type or both.
