specification:
  - |
    It is recommended that applications allow users to chose how `CONFIDENTIAL`
    and/or `PRIVACY` data is handled when interfacing with other users or
    applications, for example by allowing them to exclude such data when exporting.
    
    When a [List] of `RESN` enumeration values are present, all apply.
    
    <div class="example">
    
    The line `1 RESN CONFIDENTIAL, LOCKED` means the superstructure's data is both
    considered confidential *and* read-only.
    
    </div>
    
    Since `RESN` was introduced in version 5.5 the intent of the `PRIVACY` value
    has been interpreted differently by different applications. Known
    interpretations include
    
    - Some assign `PRIVACY` by algorithm or policy, unlike the user-assigned
      `CONFIDENTIAL`
    - Some use `PRIVACY` to mark records that have already had private data removed
    - Some use the English definitions of "privacy" and "confidential" to inform
      different restrictions for each
    
    There may also be applications using `PRIVACY` with interpretations not listed
    above.
    
    Because these different interpretations became widespread before they were
    identified, determining which one is meant generally requires knowledge of
    which application applied the `PRIVACY` restriction notice. It is anticipated
    that a future version will deprecate the `PRIVACY` option and introduce new
    values for each of its current use cases.
