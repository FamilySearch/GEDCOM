type: structure

uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/CROP

standard tag: CROP

specification:
  - Crop
  - |
    A subregion of an image to display. It is only valid when the
    superstructure links to a MULTIMEDIA_RECORD with at least 1 FILE
    substructure that refers to an external file with a defined pixel unit.
    
    LEFT and TOP indicate the top-left corner of the region to display. WIDTH
    and HEIGHT indicate how many pixels wide and tall the region to display is.
    If omitted, LEFT and TOP each default to 0; WIDTH defaults to the image
    width minus LEFT; and HEIGHT defaults to the image height minus TOP.
    
    If the superstructure links to a MULTIMEDIA_RECORD that includes multiple
    FILE substructures, the CROP applies to the first FILE to which it can
    apply, namely the first external file with a defined pixel unit.
    
    It is recommended that CROP be used only with a single-FILE
    MULTIMEDIA_RECORD.
    
    The following are errors:
    
    -   LEFT or LEFT + WIDTH exceed the image width.
    -   TOP or TOP + HEIGHT exceed the image height.
    -   CROP applied to a non-image or image without a defined pixel unit.
