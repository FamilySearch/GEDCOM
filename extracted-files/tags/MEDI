uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/MEDI

standard tag: MEDI

specification:
  - Medium
  - |
    An enumerated value from set https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enumset-MEDI
    providing information about the media or the medium in which information is
    stored.
    
    When MEDI is a substructure of a https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/CALN, it is
    recommended that its payload describes the medium directly found at that
    call number rather than a medium from which it was derived.
    
    Consider an asset in a repository that is a digital scan of a book of
    compiled newspapers; for this asset, the CALN.MEDI is recommended to be
    ELECTRONIC rather than BOOK or NEWSPAPER.
