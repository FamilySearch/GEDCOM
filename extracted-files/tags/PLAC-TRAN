    A representation of the superstructure’s data in a different format.
    
    In some situations it is desirable to provide the same semantic content in
    multiple formats. Where this is desirable, a TRAN substructure is used,
    where the specific format is given in its language tag substructure, media
    type substructure, or both.
    
    Different TRAN structures are used in different contexts to fully capture
    the structure of the information being presented in multiple formats. In
    all cases, a TRAN structure’s payload and substructures should provide only
    information also contained in the TRAN structures’ superstructure, but
    provide it in a new language, script, or media type.
    
    Each TRAN substructure must have either a language tag or a media type or
    both. Each TRAN structure must differ from its superstructure and from
    every other TRAN substructure of its superstructure in either its language
    tag or its media type or both.
