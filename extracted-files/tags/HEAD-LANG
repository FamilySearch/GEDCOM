standard tag: LANG

specification:
  - Language
  - |
    A default language which may be used to interpret any Text-typed payloads
    that lack a specific language tag from a https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/LANG
    structure. An application may choose to use a different default based on
    its knowledge of the language preferences of the user.
    
    The payload of the LANG structure is a language tag, as defined by BCP 47.
    
    Some algorithms on text are language-specific. Examples include sorting
    sequences, name comparison and phonetic name matching algorithms,
    spell-checking, computer-synthesized speech, Braille transcription, and
    language translation. When the language of the text is given through a
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/LANG, that should be used. When
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/LANG is not available,
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/HEAD-LANG provides the file creator’s suggested
    default language. For some language-specific algorithms, the user’s
    preferred language may be a more appropriate default than the file’s
    default language. User language preferences can be found in a variety of
    platform-specific places, such as the default language from operating
    system settings, user locales, Input Method Editors (IMEs), etc.
