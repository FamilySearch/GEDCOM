specification:
  - Repository
  - See `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_CITATION`.

    This structure is used within a source record to point to a name and address
    record of the holder of the source document. Formal and informal repository
    name and addresses are stored in the `REPOSITORY_RECORD`. More formal
    repositories, such as the Family History Library, should show a call number of
    the source at that repository. The call number of that source should be
    recorded using a `CALN` substructure.
    
    A `DATE` substructure can be used to denote the date when the source was known
    to be held by the specific holder. For example, if a Family Bible was passed
    from one person to another over time, a `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_CITATION` with a
    `DATE` substructure can be used to track the provenance as it was handed down.
