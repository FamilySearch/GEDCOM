specification:

    A tag definition consists of an extension tag, a space, and a URI. It defines
    that the extension tag is used to refer to the concept identified by that URI.
    See [Extension Tags] for more details.
    
    The URIs in Tag Definitions have the same requirements and recommendations as
    those defined by the [URI] data type.
    
    ```abnf
    TagDef = extTag D URI-reference
    ```
    
    The URI for the `TagDef` data type is `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/type-TagDef`.
