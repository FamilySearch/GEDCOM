    The Hebrew calendar is the name given to the calendar used by Jewish peoples
    around the world which developed into its current form in the early ninth
    century. It traditionally marks new days at sunset, not midnight. Its first day
    (1 Tishrei 1) primarily overlapped with Gregorian 7 September 3761 BCE and
    Julian 7 October 3761 BCE (starting at sunset on the 6th day of those months).

    To keep the lunar-based months synchronized with the solar-based years, some
    years have Adar I and others do not, instead proceeding from Shevat directly to
    Adar II. However, in common (non-leap) years, it is common to simply write
    "Adar" not "Adar II", which users not aware of the distinction might
    incorrectly encode as `ADR` instead of `ADS`. It is recommended that systems
    knowing which years had Adar I and which did not replace `ADR` in common years
    with `ADS`.
