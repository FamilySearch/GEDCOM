    The Hebrew calendar is the name given to the calendar used by Jewish
    peoples around the world which developed into its current form in the early
    ninth century. It traditionally marks new days at sunset, not midnight. Its
    first day (1 Tishrei 1) primarily overlapped with Gregorian 7 September
    3761 BCE and Julian 7 October 3761 BCE (starting at sunset on the 6th day
    of those months).

    To keep the lunar-based months synchronized with the solar-based years,
    some years have Adar I and others do not, instead proceeding from Shevat
    directly to Adar II. However, in common (non-leap) years, it is common to
    simply write “Adar” not “Adar II”, which users not aware of the distinction
    might incorrectly encode as ADR instead of ADS. It is recommended that
    systems knowing which years had Adar I and which did not replace ADR in
    common years with ADS.
