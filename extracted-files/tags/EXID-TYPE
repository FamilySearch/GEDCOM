standard tag: TYPE

specification:
  - Type
  - |
    The authority issuing the EXID, represented as a URI. It is recommended
    that this be a URL.
    
    If the authority maintains stable URLs for each identifier it issues, it is
    recommended that the TYPE payload be selected such that appending the EXID
    payload to it yields that URL. However, this is not required and a
    different URI for the set of issued identifiers may be used instead.
    
    Registered URIs are listed in exid-types.json, where fields include:
    
    -   “label”: a short string suitable for display in a user interface.
    -   “type”: The URI representing the authority issuing the EXID.
    -   “description”: A description of the meaning of the EXID.
    -   “contact”: A contact email address for the person or organization
        registering the URI.
    -   “change-controller”: The name or contact information for the person or
        organization authorized to update the registration.
    -   “fragment”: If present, indicates a short string that can be used as a
        label for a fragment identifier appended to the URI. If absent,
        indicates that fragment identifiers are not used with the URI.
    -   “reference”: A URL with more information about the meaning of the EXID.
        Such information should explain the uniqueness and expected durability
        of the identifier.
    
    Additional type URIs can be registered by filing a GitHub pull request.
