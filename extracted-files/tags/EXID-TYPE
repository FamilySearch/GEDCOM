standard tag: 'TYPE'

specification:
  - Type
  - |
    The authority issuing the `EXID`, represented as a URI. It is recommended that
    this be a URL.
    
    If the authority maintains stable URLs for each identifier it issues, it is
    recommended that the `TYPE` payload be selected such that appending the `EXID`
    payload to it yields that URL. However, this is not required and a different
    URI for the set of issued identifiers may be used instead.
    
    Registered URIs are listed in the [exid-types registry], where fields are
    defined using the [YAML file format].
    
    Additional type URIs can be registered by filing a [GitHub pull request].
