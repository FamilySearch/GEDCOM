specification:
  - Alias
  - |
    Indicates that the user described by the superstructure is the same person as
    the individual described by the referenced `INDI`.
    
    A `SUBM` may only have a single `INDI` linked in this way to simplify
    implementation of algorithms that depend on the `INDI` representing a
    particular user. Applications using `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/ALIA` to
    represent a person with multiple `INDI` records should select or generate a
    representative `INDI` for the `SUBM`.`ALIA`.
