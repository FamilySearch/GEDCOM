    An event structure may be used to discuss an event even if the event is not
    known to have occurred. See [Events] for a discussion of how `DATE`, `PLAC`,
    and the optional `Y` payload indicate whether the structure is asserting the
    event occurred. See the `NON_EVENT_STRUCTURE` for how to state an event did not
    occur.
    
    <div class="note">
    
    Family event structures vary as follows:
    
    - `FAM`.`EVEN` has a [Text] payload; others may have a `Y` payload
    - `FAM`.`EVEN` requires `TYPE`; it's optional for others
    
    </div>
