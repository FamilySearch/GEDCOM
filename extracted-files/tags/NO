uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/NO

standard tag: 'NO'

specification:
  - Did not happen
  - An enumerated value from set https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enumset-EVEN
    identifying an event type which did not occur to the superstructure’s
    subject. See NON_EVENT_STRUCTURE for more.
  - |
    Indicates that a specific type of event, given in the payload, did not
    happen within a given date period (or never happened if there is no DATE
    substructure).
    
    Substructures may provide discussion about the non-occurrence of the event
    but must not limit the meaning of what did not occur. No substructure other
    than DATE may restrict the breadth of that negative assertion.
    
    1 NO MARR means “no marriage occurred”

        2 DATE TO 24 MAR 1880
    
    means “no marriage had occurred as of March 24^(th), 1880”
