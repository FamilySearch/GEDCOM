standard tag: 'NO'

specification:
  - Negative assertion
  - |
    An enumerated value from set `https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enumset-NO`
    identifying something that was not part of the superstructure: an event type
    which did not occur to the superstructure's subject, that the superstructure's
    subject did not have an name or name part, etc. A specific payload `NO XYZ`
    should only appear where `XYZ` would be legal.
    
    See `NEGATIVE_ASSERTION` for more.
  - |
    Indicates that a specific type of event, given in the payload, did not happen
    within a given date period (or never happened if there is no `DATE`
    substructure).
    
    Substructures may provide discussion about the non-occurrence of the event but
    must not limit the meaning of what did not occur. No substructure other than
    `DATE` may restrict the breadth of that negative assertion.
    
    <div class="example">
    
    `1 NO MARR` means "no marriage occurred"
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
    
    ```gedcom
    1 NO MARR
    2 DATE TO 24 MAR 1880
    ```
    
    means "no marriage had occurred as of March 24^th^, 1880"
    
    </div>
