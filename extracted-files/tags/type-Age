  - |
    Ages are represented by counts of years, months, weeks, and days.
    
        Age         = [ageBound D] ageDuration
    
        ageBound    = "<" / ">"
        ageDuration = years [D months] [D weeks] [D days]
                    / months [D weeks] [D days]
                    / weeks [D days]
                    / days
    
        years   = Integer %x79    ; 35y
        months  = Integer %x6D    ; 11m
        weeks   = Integer %x77    ; 8w
        days    = Integer %x64    ; 21d

      Production   Meaning
      ------------ ------------------------------------------------
      <            The real age was less than the provided age
      >            The real age was greater than the provided age
      years        a number of years
      months       a number of months
      weeks        a number of weeks
      days         a number of days
    
    Non-integer numbers should be rounded down to an integer. Thus, if someone
    has lived for 363.5 days, their age might be written as 363d, 51w 6d, 51w,
    0y, etc.
    
    Because numbers are rounded down, > effectively includes its endpoint; that
    is, the age > 8d includes people who have lived 8 days + a few seconds.
    
    Different cultures count ages differently. Some increment years on the
    anniversary of birth and others at particular seasons. Some round to the
    nearest year, others round years down, others round years up. Because users
    may be unaware of these traditions or may fail to convert them to the
    round-down convention, errors in age of up to a year are common.
    
    Age payloads may also be omitted entirely if no suitable form is known but
    a substructure (such as a PHRASE) is desired.
    
    Versions 5.5 and 5.5.1 allowed a few specific phrases inside Age payloads.
    Age phrases were moved to the PHRASE substructure in 7.0.
