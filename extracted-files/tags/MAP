standard tag: MAP

specification:
  - Map
  - |
    A representative point for a location, as defined by LATI and LONG
    substructures.
    
    Note that MAP provides neither a notion of accuracy (for example, the MAP
    for a birth event may be some distance from the point where the birth
    occurred) nor a notion of region size (for example, the MAP for a place
    “Belarus” may be anywhere within that nation’s 200,000 square kilometer
    area).
