descriptions:
  - |
    The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC and
    subsequently amended by Augustus in about 8 BC to correct an error in the
    application of its leap year rule during its first 3 decades. Years had
    been counted from various starting epochs during the Julian calendarâ€™s use;
    the version specified by this specification uses the same starting epoch as
    the Gregorian calendar.
    
    This calendar uses the same months as the Gregorian calendar, differing
    only in which years February has 29 days.
    
    The epoch marker BCE is permitted in this calendar; year y BCE indicates a
    year y years before year 1. Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was
    followed by year 1.
