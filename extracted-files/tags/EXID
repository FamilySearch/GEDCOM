uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/EXID

standard tag: EXID

descriptions:
  - External Identifier
  - |
    An identifier for the subject of the superstructure. The identifier is
    maintained by some external authority; the authority owning the identifier
    is provided in the TYPE substructure; see EXID.TYPE for more.
    
    Depending on the maintaining authority, an EXID may be a unique identifier
    for the subject, an identifier for 1 of several views of the subject, or an
    identifier for the externally-maintained copy of the same information as is
    contained in this structure. However, unlike UID and REFN, EXID does not
    identify a structure; structures with the same EXID may have originated
    independently rather than by edits from the same starting point.
