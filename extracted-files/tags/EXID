standard tag: 'EXID'

specification:
  - External Identifier
  - |
    An identifier for the subject of the superstructure. The identifier is
    maintained by some external authority; the authority owning the identifier is
    provided in the TYPE substructure; see `EXID`.`TYPE` for more details.
    
    Depending on the maintaining authority, an `EXID` may be a unique identifier
    for the subject, an identifier for 1 of several views of the subject, or an
    identifier for the externally-maintained copy of the same information as is
    contained in this structure. However, unlike `UID` and `REFN`, `EXID` does not
    identify a structure; structures with the same `EXID` may have originated
    independently rather than by edits from the same starting point.
    
    `EXID` identifiers are expected to be unique. Once assigned, an `EXID`
    identifier should never be re-used for any other purpose.

    <div class="deprecation">
    
    Having an `EXID` without an `EXID`.`TYPE` substructure is deprecated. The
    meaning of an `EXID` depends on its `EXID`.`TYPE`. The cardinality of
    `EXID`.`TYPE` will be changed to `{1:1}` in version 8.0.
    
    </div>
    
    Each of these provides an identifier for a structure or its subject, and each
    is different in purpose:
    
    - `REFN` is a user-generated identifier for a structure.
    
    - `UID` is a globally-unique identifier for a structure.
    
    - `EXID` is an identifier maintained by an external authority that applies to
      the subject of the structure.
