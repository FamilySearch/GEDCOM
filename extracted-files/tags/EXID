type: structure

uri: https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/EXID

standard tag: EXID

specification:
  - External Identifier
  - |
    An identifier for the subject of the superstructure. The identifier is
    maintained by some external authority; the authority owning the identifier
    is provided in the TYPE substructure; see EXID.TYPE for more.
    
    Depending on the maintaining authority, an EXID may be a unique identifier
    for the subject, an identifier for 1 of several views of the subject, or an
    identifier for the externally-maintained copy of the same information as is
    contained in this structure. However, unlike UID and REFN, EXID does not
    identify a structure; structures with the same EXID may have originated
    independently rather than by edits from the same starting point.
    
    EXID identifiers are expected to be unique. Once assigned, an EXID
    identifier should never be re-used for any other purpose.
