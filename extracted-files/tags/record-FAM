    The common case is that each couple has one FAM record, but that is not
    always the case.
    
    A couple that separates and then gets together again can be represented
    either as a single FAM with multiple events (MARR, DIV, etc.) or as a
    separate FAM for each time together. Some user interfaces may display these
    two in different ways and the two admit different semantics in sourcing. A
    single FAM with two MARR with distinct dates might also represent
    uncertainty about dates and a pair of FAM with same spouses might also be
    the result of merging multiple files.
    
    Implementers should support both representations, and should choose between
    them based on user input or other context beyond that provided in the
    datasets themselves.

    The FAM record was originally structured to represent families where a male
    HUSB (husband or father) and female WIFE (wife or mother) produce CHIL
    (children). The FAM record may also be used for cultural parallels to this,
    including nuclear families, marriage, cohabitation, fostering, adoption,
    and so on, regardless of the gender of the partners. Sex, gender, titles,
    and roles of partners should not be inferred based on the partner that the
    HUSB or WIFE structure points to.
    
    The individuals pointed to by the HUSB and WIFE are collectively referred
    to as “partners”, “parents” or “spouses”.
    
    Some displays may be unable to display more than 2 partners. Displays may
    use HUSB and WIFE as layout hints, for example, by consistently displaying
    the HUSB on the same side of the WIFE in a tree view. Family structures
    with more than 2 partners may either use several FAM records or use
    ASSOCIATION_STRUCTUREs to indicate additional partners.
    
    The FAM record will be revised in a future version to more fully express
    the diversity of human family relationships.
    
    The order of the CHIL (children) pointers within a FAM (family) structure
    should be chronological by birth; this is an exception to the usual “most
    preferred value first” rule. A CHIL with a voidPtr indicates a placeholder
    for an unknown child in this birth order.
    
    If a FAM record uses HUSB or WIFE to point to an INDI record, the INDI
    record must use FAMS to point to the FAM record. If a FAM record uses CHIL
    to point to an INDI record, the INDI record must use a FAMC to point to the
    FAM record.
