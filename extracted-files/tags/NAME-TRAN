specification:

    A type of `TRAN` substructure specific to [Personal Names]. Each
    `NAME`.`TRAN` must have a `LANG` substructure. See also `INDI`.`NAME`.
    
    <div class="example">
    
    The following presents a name in Mandarin, transliterated using Pinyin
    
    ```gedcom
    1 NAME /孔/德庸
    2 GIVN 德庸
    2 SURN 孔
    2 TRAN /Kǒng/ Déyōng
    3 GIVN Déyōng
    3 SURN Kǒng
    3 LANG zh-pinyin
    ```
    
    </div>

    A representation of the superstructure's data in a different format.
    
    In some situations it is desirable to provide the same semantic content in
    multiple formats. Where this is desirable, a `TRAN` substructure is used, where
    the specific format is given in its language tag substructure, media type
    substructure, or both.
    
    Different `TRAN` structures are used in different contexts to fully capture the
    structure of the information being presented in multiple formats. In all cases,
    a `TRAN` structure's payload and substructures should provide only information
    also contained in the `TRAN` structures' superstructure, but provide it in a
    new language, script, or media type.
    
    Each `TRAN` substructure must have either a language tag or a media type or
    both. Each `TRAN` structure must differ from its superstructure and from every
    other `TRAN` substructure of its superstructure in either its language tag or
    its media type or both.
