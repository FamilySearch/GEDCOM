specification:
  - Translation
  - |
    A type of TRAN for unstructured human-readable text, such as is found in
    NOTE and SNOTE payloads. Each https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/NOTE-TRAN must
    have either a LANG substructure or a MIME substructure or both. If either
    is missing, it is assumed to have the same value as the superstructure. See
    also NOTE and SNOTE.
    
    The following presents the same note in HTML-format English; in plain-text
    with the same language as the superstructure (English); and in Spanish with
    the same media type as the superstructure (HTML).
    
        1 NAME Arete /Hernandez/
        2 NOTE Named after Arete from <i>The Odyssey</i>
        3 LANG en
        3 MIME text/html
        3 TRAN Named after Arete from "The Odyssey"
        4 MIME text/plain
        3 TRAN Nombrada en honor a Arete de <i>La Odisea</i>
        4 LANG es
    
    It is recommended that text given in text/html should only be translated
    into text/plain if the resulting text is different from the text created by
    the HTML-to-text conversion process defined in
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/MIME.
  - |
    A representation of the superstructure’s data in a different format.
    
    In some situations it is desirable to provide the same semantic content in
    multiple formats. Where this is desirable, a TRAN substructure is used,
    where the specific format is given in its language tag substructure, media
    type substructure, or both.
    
    Different TRAN structures are used in different contexts to fully capture
    the structure of the information being presented in multiple formats. In
    all cases, a TRAN structure’s payload and substructures should provide only
    information also contained in the TRAN structures’ superstructure, but
    provide it in a new language, script, or media type.
    
    Each TRAN substructure must have either a language tag or a media type or
    both. Each TRAN structure must differ from its superstructure and from
    every other TRAN substructure of its superstructure in either its language
    tag or its media type or both.
