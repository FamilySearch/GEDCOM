    The Gregorian calendar is the now-ubiquitous calendar introduced by Pope
    Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct the Julian calendar which was slowly drifting
    relative to the seasons.
    
    Permitted months are
    
    | Code  | Name      |
    | :---- | :-------- |
    | `JAN` | January   |
    | `FEB` | February  |
    | `MAR` | March     |
    | `APR` | April     |
    | `MAY` | May       |
    | `JUN` | June      |
    | `JUL` | July      |
    | `AUG` | August    |
    | `SEP` | September |
    | `OCT` | October   |
    | `NOV` | November  |
    | `DEC` | December  |
    
    The epoch marker `BCE` is permitted in this calendar; year *y* BCE indicates a
    year *y* years before year 1. Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was followed
    by year 1.
