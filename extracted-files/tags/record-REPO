standard tag: REPO

specification:
  - Repository
  - See REPOSITORY_RECORD.
  - |
    The repository record provides information about an institution or person
    that has a collection of sources. Informal repositories include the owner
    of an unpublished work or of a rare published source, or a keeper of
    personal collections. An example would be the owner of a family Bible
    containing unpublished family genealogical entries.
    
    Layered repositories, such as an archive containing copies of a subset of
    records from another archive or archives that have moved or been bought by
    other archives, are not modeled in this version of the specification. It is
    expected they will be added in a later version. Until such time, it is
    recommended that the repository record store current contact information,
    if known.
