specification:
  - Name
  - A PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE with parts, translations, sources, and so forth.
  - |
    Names of individuals are represented in the manner the name is normally
    spoken, with the family name, surname, or nearest cultural parallel
    thereunto separated by slashes (U+002F /). Based on the dynamic nature or
    unknown compositions of naming conventions, it is difficult to provide a
    more detailed name piece structure to handle every case. The
    PERSONAL_NAME_PIECES are provided optionally for systems that cannot
    operate effectively with less structured information. The Personal Name
    payload shall be seen as the primary name representation, with name pieces
    as optional auxiliary information; in particular it is recommended that all
    name parts in PERSONAL_NAME_PIECES appear within the PersonalName payload
    in some form, possibly adjusted for gender-specific suffixes or the like.
    It is permitted for the payload to contain information not present in any
    name piece substructure.
    
    The name may be translated or transliterated into different languages or
    scripts using the TRAN substructure. It is recommended, but not required,
    that if the name pieces are used, the same pieces are used in each
    translation and transliteration.
    
    A TYPE is used to specify the particular variation that this name is. For
    example; it could indicate that this name is a name taken at immigration or
    that it could be an ‘also known as’ name. See
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enumset-NAME-TYPE for more.
    
    Alternative approaches to representing names are being considered for
    future versions of this specification.
