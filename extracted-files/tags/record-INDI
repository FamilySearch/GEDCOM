specification:
  - Individual
  - See INDIVIDUAL_RECORD.

    The individual record is a compilation of facts or hypothesized facts about
    an individual. These facts may come from multiple sources. Source citations
    and notes allow documentation of the source where each of the facts were
    discovered.
    
    A single individual may have facts distributed across multiple individual
    records, connected by ALIA (alias, in the computing sense not the pseudonym
    sense) pointers. See ALIA for more.
    
    Individual records are linked to Family records by use of bi-directional
    pointers. Details about those links are stored as substructures of the
    pointers in the individual record.
    
    Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSO
    (association) tag. The personâ€™s relation or associate is the person being
    pointed to. The association or relationship is stated by the value on the
    subordinate ROLE line.
    
    The following example refers to 2 individuals, @I1@ and @I2@, where @I2@ is
    a godparent of @I1@:
    
        0 @I1@ INDI
        1 ASSO @I2@
        2 ROLE GODP
    
    Events stored as facts within an INDI record may also have FAMC or ASSO
    tags to indicate families and individuals that participated in those
    events. For example, a FAMC pointer subordinate to an adoption event
    indicates a relationship to family by adoption; biological parents can be
    shown by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event; the eulogist at a
    funeral can be shown by an ASSO pointer subordinate to the burial event;
    and so on. A subordinate FAMC pointer is allowed to refer to a family where
    the individual does not appear as a child.
