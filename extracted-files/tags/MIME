specification:
  - Media type
  - |
    Indicates the [media type] of the payload of the superstructure.
    
    As of version 7.0, only 2 media types are supported by this structure:
    
    - `text/plain` shall be presented to the user as-is, preserving all spacing,
      line breaks, and so forth.
    
    - `text/html` uses HTML tags to provide presentation information. Applications
      should support at least the following:
    
      - `p` and `br` elements for paragraphing and line breaks.
      - `b`, `i`, `u`, and `s` elements for bold, italic, underlined, and
        strike-through text (or corresponding display in other locales; see [HTML
        §4.5] for more).
      - `sup` and `sub` elements for super- and sub-script.
      - The 3 XML entities that appear in text: `&amp;`, `&lt;` `&gt;`. Note that
        `&quote;` and `&apos;` are only needed in attributes. Other entities should
        be represented as their respective Unicode characters instead.
    
      Supporting more of HTML is encouraged. Unsupported tags should be ignored
      during display.
    
    <div class="note">
    
    Applications are welcome to support more XML entities or HTML character
    references in their user interface. However, exporting must only use the core
    XML entities, translating any other entities into their corresponding Unicode
    characters.
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
    
    Applications are welcome to support additional HTML elements, but they should
    ensure that content is meaningful if those extra elements are ignored and only
    their content text is displayed.
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
    
    Media types are also used by external files, as described under `FORM`.
    External file media types are not limited to `text/plain` and `text/html`.
    
    </div>
    
    If needed, `text/html` can be converted to `text/plain` using the following
    steps:
    
    1. Replace any sequence of 1 or more spaces, tabs, and line breaks with a
       single space
    2. Case-insensitively replace each `<p`...`>`, `</p`...`>`, and `<br`...`>`
       with a line break
    3. Remove all other `<`...`>` tags
    4. Replace each `&lt;` with `<` and `&gt;` with `>`
    5. Replace each `&amp;` with `&`
