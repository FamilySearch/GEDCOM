specification:
  - Media type
  - |
    Indicates the media type of the payload of the superstructure, as defined
    by BCP 13.
    
    As of version 7.0, only 2 media types are supported by this structure:
    
    -   text/plain shall be presented to the user as-is, preserving all
        spacing, line breaks, and so forth.
    
    -   text/html uses HTML tags to provide presentation information.
        Applications should support at least the following:
    
        -   p and br elements for paragraphing and line breaks.
        -   b, i, u, and s elements for bold, italic, underlined, and
            strike-through text (or corresponding display in other locales; see
            HTML §4.5 for more).
        -   sup and sub elements for super- and sub-script.
        -   The 3 XML entities that appear in text: &amp;, &lt; &gt;. Note that
            &quote; and &apos; are only needed in attributes. Other entities
            should be represented as their respective Unicode characters
            instead.
    
        Supporting more of HTML is encouraged. Unsupported elements should be
        ignored during display.
    
    Applications are welcome to support more XML entities or HTML character
    references in their user interface. However, exporting must only use the
    core XML entities, translating any other entities into their corresponding
    Unicode characters.
    
    Applications are welcome to support additional HTML elements, but they
    should ensure that content is meaningful if those extra elements are
    ignored and only their content text is displayed.
    
    Media types are also used by external files, as described under FORM.
    External file media types are not limited to text/plain and text/html.
    
    If needed, text/html can be converted to text/plain using the following
    steps:
    
    1.  Replace any sequence of 1 or more spaces, tabs, and line breaks with a
        single space
    2.  Case-insensitively replace each <p…>, </p…>, and <br…> with a line
        break
    3.  Remove all other <…> tags
    4.  Replace each &lt; with < and &gt; with >
    5.  Replace each &amp; with &
