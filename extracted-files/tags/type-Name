specification:
  - |
    A personal name is mostly free-text. It should be the name as written in
    the culture of the individual and should not contain line breaks, repeated
    spaces, or characters not part of the written form of a name (except for
    U+002F as explained below).
    
        PersonalName = nameStr
                     / [nameStr] "/" [nameStr] "/" [nameStr]
    
        nameChar     = %x20-2E / %x30-10FFFF  ; any but '/' and '\t'
        nameStr      = 1*nameChar
    
    The character U+002F (/, slash or solidus) has special meaning in a
    personal name, being used to delimit the portion of the name that most
    closely matches the concept of a surname, family name, or the like. This
    specification does not provide any standard way of representing names that
    contain U+002F.
