specification:
  - |
    An enumeration is a selection from a set of options. They are represented
    as a string matching the same production as a tag, with the additional
    permission that standard enumerations may be integers.
    
        stdEnum = stdTag / Integer
        Enum    = stdEnum / extTag
    
    Each structure type with an enumeration payload also defines specific
    payload values it permits. These permitted payloads match production
    stdEnum and should each have a defined URI. Payload values that match
    production extTag are always permitted in structures with an enumeration
    payload and have their URI defined by the schema.
    
    Each enumeration value has a distinct meaning as identified by its
    corresponding URI.
    
    The URI of a given tag in an enumeration payload is determined by the tag
    itself and by the structure type of the structure it is in the payload of.
    
    The tag HUSB is used in this document to represent two enumeration values.
    Which one is meant can be identified by the structure type it appears in as
    follows:
    
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Containing structure type              Enumeration value identified by tag HUSB
      -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
      https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/FAMC-ADOP   https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enum-ADOP-HUSB
    
      https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/ROLE        https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/enum-HUSB
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    An extension could also place either of these enumeration values in an
    extension structure type; the extension authors should document which one
    they permit.
    
    The HUSB tag is also used to identify two different structure types,
    https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/FAM-HUSB and https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/HUSB.
    
    The URI for the Enum data type is https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/type-Enum.
