type: structure

standard tag: ADDR

specification:
  - Address
  - The location of, or most relevant to, the subject of the superstructure.
    See ADDRESS_STRUCTURE for more.

    A specific building, plot, or location. The payload is the full formatted
    address as it would appear on a mailing label, including appropriate line
    breaks (encoded using CONT tags). The expected order of address components
    varies by region; the address should be organized as expected by the
    addressed region.
    
    Optionally, additional substructures such as STAE and CTRY are provided to
    be used by systems that have structured their addresses for indexing and
    sorting. If the substructures and ADDR payload disagree, the ADDR payload
    shall be taken as correct. Because the regionally-correct order and
    formatting of address components cannot be determined from the
    substructures alone, the ADDR payload is required, even if its content
    appears to be redundant with the substructures.
    
    ADR1 and ADR2 were introduced in version 5.5 (1996) and ADR3 in version
    5.5.1 (1999), defined as “The first/second/third line of an address.” Some
    applications interpreted ADR1 as “the first line of the street address”,
    but most took the spec as-written and treated it as a straight copy of a
    line of text already available in the ADDR payload.
    
    Duplicating information bloats files and introduces the potential for
    self-contradiction. ADR1, ADR2, and ADR3 should not be added to new files.
