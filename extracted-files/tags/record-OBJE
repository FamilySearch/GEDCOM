standard tag: 'OBJE'

specification:
  - Object
  - See `MULTIMEDIA_RECORD`.
  - |
    The multimedia record refers to 1 or more external digital files, and may
    provide some additional information about the files and the media they encode.
    
    The file reference can occur more than once to group multiple files together.
    Grouped files should each pertain to the same context. For example, a sound
    clip and a photo both of the same event might be grouped in a single `OBJE`.
    
    The change and creation dates should be for the `OBJE` record itself, not the
    underlying files.
    
    A `MULTIMEDIA_RECORD` may contain a pointer to a `SOURCE_RECORD` and vice
    versa. Applications must not create datasets where these mutual pointers form a
    cycle. Applications should also ensure they can handle invalid files with such
    cycles in a safe manner.
