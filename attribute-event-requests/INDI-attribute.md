- `MILT`.`TYPE`:  enumeration can provide a user-language-specific indication of the various concepts found in serving in the military.  GEDCOM-X suggests multiple additions that are âmilitary basedâ events. A single event MILT with Typification of, a) induction, b) rank, c) discharge, d) engagement, e) registration, f) deployment, g) other/phrase (NOTE: GEDCOM X has a dozen or more of these, some are subset of others (there are over 300 separation codes as part of a âdischargeâ.
